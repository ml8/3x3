# Customizing keys with via

The pad supports configuring the keymap with VIA. You can use
[usevia.app](https://usevia.app/) to configure the keymap. However, until the
keyboard config is merged in via's repo, you'll need to upload the JSON
manually.

* To do this, go the "Settings" menu in via and click "Show Design tab." 
* This will allow you to upload the JSON from this directory (go to the design
  tab, then select "Load Draft Definition".
* Select the `ml8_9.json` file from this directory. 
* You can now use via normally (click on the first tab to program the pad).
* After you're done, if you want to update the layer text for the OLED, use the
  included [programmer](../cli/README.md).
